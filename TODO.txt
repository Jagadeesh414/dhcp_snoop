Better form a DHCP packet struct and handle using that struct.

After discussion with Raghu sir, IP source guard works only in L2 mode.
No need to maintain allowed router list. Since we are performing IP source guarding at L2 mode.

Mechanism:

Initially all ports are Untrusted.
Chnage Untrusted port state to trusted state... If port is connected to Router/Switch/DHCP server.
No need to maintain DHCP snoop table for trusted ports.
If packet is coming on trusted port, no need to check IP-MAC relation.
If packet is coming on untrusted port, checp IP-MAC relation with DHCP snoop table.
	If IP-MAC relation is correct..... allow the packet.
	If IP-MAC relation is in correct... just drop thr packet.
