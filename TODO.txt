0. Add this module in kernel as loadable kernel module.. not as a static since it may be requiered to load/unload module dynamically.
1. Add VLAN info in DHCP snoop table... And the code that checks for IP spoof should use VLAN information also when it tries to find an entry from the snoop table and makes a comparison with IP.

2. No need to implement learning snoop entry from traffic.

3. To support static env better way, admin can add MAC-IP entries manually.

4. When IP spoof is enabled by admin... then Reverse Path Filtering(RPF) also should be enforced.
    Take care of this thing when implementing UI.

Verify relay case:
when DHCP ACK packet is coming from DHCP server, Check the code and test.

static entries: 
allow admin to add IP-MAC relation statically 



/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Better form a DHCP packet struct and handle using that struct.

After discussion with Raghu sir, IP source guard works only in L2 mode.
No need to maintain allowed router list. Since we are performing IP source guarding at L2 mode.

Mechanism:

Initially all ports are Untrusted.
Chnage Untrusted port state to trusted state... If port is connected to Router/Switch/DHCP server.
No need to maintain DHCP snoop table for trusted ports.
If packet is coming on trusted port, no need to check IP-MAC relation.
If packet is coming on untrusted port, checp IP-MAC relation with DHCP snoop table.
	If IP-MAC relation is correct..... allow the packet.
	If IP-MAC relation is in correct... just drop thr packet.
